## Ploopy Adept BTU Mod by bomtarnes ([keyboard-magpie](https://github.com/keyboard-magpie/))

Included are two print files-

 - adept-btu-plate.3mf - this includes an integrated support enforcer- I recommend organic supports and "for support enforcers only in prusaslicer
 - adept-btu-top-v1.stl - old fashioned STL for doing as you wish with

Also included is a step file, and a fusion 360 export (my CAD is all self taught and very messy, timeline wise, sorry).

The following 7.5mm diameter BTUs are compatibles with this mod:
* [Veichu 7.5 BTUs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003066404497.html)
* [MiSUMi BCHA7.5 - Stainless Steel Main Ball](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300427030/?ProductCode=BCHA7.5)
* [MiSUMi BCHAJ7.5 - POM Main Ball](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300427030/?ProductCode=BCHAJ7.5)

I am actively working on other versions for other BTU varieties and will aim to add these in the future.

Please do not contact the core ploopy team for any issues with this mod, I can be reached through my github account linked above or on discord.
