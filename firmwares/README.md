## What is "drag_scroll_click_and_hold" vs. "drag_scroll_toggle"?

Each directory contains a type of firmware. For "click_and_hold", the drag scroll functionality works by clicking and holding the drag scroll button.

For "toggle", the drag scroll functionality works by clicking to turn on the drag scroll, and clicking again to turn it off.

## What is "semaphore_X"?

That is a notation of how sensitive the drag scroll is.

"semaphore_8" is the **least sensitive** drag scroll. That means, you'll have to move the ball more to scroll.

"semaphore_0" is the **most sensitive** drag scroll. That means, you'll have to move the ball less to scroll.

## What is "alternative"?

It is custom firmware with alternative key layout and improved scrolling. In this version top-left button works as right mouse button and top-right button is a scroll controll button.

The click-and-hold and drag scroll functionality has been combined into one. If you hold the key and move the ball it will keep scrolling as long as you keep the button pressed. If you click the button quickly it will toggle scrolling until you click it again. There is no need to choose the method, you can use both at the same time.

Firmware files ending with "fast" and "slow" have different scrolling speeds, "alt_inv" has vertical scrolling inverted and "alt_legacy" is the original key layout, but with better scrolling.

Those firmware files also work with (VIA)[https://usevia.app]. So you can customize the key layout while keeping the combined drag functionality.
